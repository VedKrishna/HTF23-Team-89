The former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister added the public will no longer be misled by such promises as these are considered as ‘hoax’. “The people of the country are suffering from inflation, poverty, unemployment and corruption. But both the Congress and the BJP are trying to capitalise on caste census, OBC and women reservation ahead of the elections so that they can cover up their failures. But the public will no longer be misled as they will consider it a hoax,” she added. ",1

"India’s first law enforcement Chief Information Security Officers’ (CISO) council was launched by DGP Anjani Kumar and Principal Secretary Jayesh Ranjan at the Cyberabad Police Commissionerate on Saturday. The CISO council will partner with public and private institutions to tackle cyber security threat in real time.The State police, with the support of industry and academia, launched the CISO council, in the presence of secretary for Society for Cyberabad Security Council (SCSC) Ramesh Kaza.“The definition of crime is changing fast. Cyber criminals operate remotely without any geographical constraints,” said Mr. Kumar during the launch.“This poses a lot of challenges for the police. The rate at which cyber crimes are rising, $8 trillion will be lost to cyber crimes by the end of 2023, which is almost a third of the GDP of the United States in 2022 and twice as much as India’s projected GDP this year,” he said.“The CISO council will be a beacon of cyber security in Telangana. It is the best example of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model that we often talk about. Cyber security breaches are multiplying and will grow by leaps and bounds when the next billion internet users start going digital. The enterprises are also going to be at risk,” said Mr. Ranjan.He cited an example of his meeting with Ajay Banga, formerly with Master Cards, who shared that the company in the US was subjected to 10,000 cyber attacks in a day and that the number would go up to 30,000 attempts.Mr. Ranjan asked the CISO council to work with the IT department and a few Centres of Excellence in the State such as Security Operations Centre, Cyber Security Centre of Excellence, Data Security Council of India and Computer Emergency Response Team. “The CISO council should work with start-ups as they are known for innovative and agile thinking and are tools of development, apart from engaging ethical hackers,” he said.“With a 300% increase in cyber crime cases in the last one year, we need to get our defence strong to tackle online crooks,” said Cyberabad Police Commissioner Stephen Raveendra.“Government organisations, critical infrastructure, and industry, including vulnerable MSMEs, are repeatedly besieged by threats and are ill-equipped to handle it, compared to their larger multinational counterparts. The recent targeted attacks on the government and critical infrastructure institutions during the G20 event in Delhi highlights the imminent need to institutionalise the fight against cyber threats,” he said.Mr. Kaza said that ransomware attacks are up by 200%, especially password-based attacks. “This year, approximately 1,56,000 daily BEC (Business Email Compromise) attempts were observed. Attacks targeting open-source software have grown by an average 742%. Gartner analysts predicted that over the next two years, 45% of global organisations will be impacted by a supply chain attack,” he said.",1

Speaking after visiting a few schools to congratulate the toppers of the assessment test, the Principal Secretary said it was unfortunate that teachers, who were expected to teach the students the importance of punctuality and responsibility, were not adhering to the same.Referring to the ‘Selfie with Toppers’ drive that was announced primarily to further motivate students to work towards their goals, Mr. Praveen Prakash directed teachers to ensure that the answer scripts were corrected and returned to students immediately. He also wanted the teachers to allow the students to retain the answer sheets with them after its evaluation.He said it was not enough for the District and Mandal Education Officers to merely pass on the instructions of the departmental higher-ups to the headmasters and teachers and instructed them to ensure their compliance in their respective jurisdiction.",1

" The IAF will unveil its new ensign at the annual Air Force Day parade at Prayagraj on Sunday to better reflect its values, 72 years after a similar exercise was undertaken.The Indian Air Force's move comes over a year after the Navy made changes in its ensign shedding its colonial past.""October 8 will go down as a momentous day in the annals of IAF history. On this historic day, the Chief of Air Staff will unveil the new IAF ensign,"" the IAF said.In the new ensign, the Indian Air Force crest will be in the top right corner.The Indian Air Force was officially established on 8 October, 1932. In view of its professional efficiency and achievements during World War II, the force was bestowed with the prefix ""Royal"" in March 1945. So, it became the Royal Indian Air Force (RIAF).In 1950, the IAF dropped its ""Royal"" prefix and amended the ensign as India became a republic.The RIAF ensign consisted of the Union Jack in the upper left canton and the RIAF roundel (red, white and blue) on the fly side. Post-Independence, the IAF ensign was created by replacing the Union Jack with the Indian tricolour and the RAF roundels with the IAF tricolour roundel in the lower right canton.""A new lAF ensign has now been created to better reflect the values of the Indian Air Force. This reaffirmation will now be reflected by the inclusion of the Air Force Crest in the top right corner of the ensign, towards the fly side,"" the IAF said in a statement.The IAF crest has the national symbol, the Ashoka lion on the top with the words 'Satyameva Jayate' in Devanagari below it.Below the Ashoka lion is a Himalayan eagle with its wings spread, denoting the fighting qualities of the IAF.A ring in light blue colour encircles the Himalayan eagle  with the words 'Bhartiya Vayu Sena.The motto of the IAF -- 'touch the sky with the glory' is inscribed below Himalayan eagle in Devanagari.The IAF motto has been taken from verse 24, Chapter 11 of the Bhagavad Gita and means ""Radiant Thou Touchest Heaven"" or in other words ""touching the sky with glory"".The Air Force Day parade and air display will be held in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh.Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan and Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari are among top military officials attending the event.The parade was traditionally held at the Hindon airbase near Delhi till 2021 before the event was taken outside the national capital.

"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have provided an opportunity to a set of women in rural Assam to make their grounded dreams take flight again. Meet Riju Begum, Romina Begum, Himadri Talukdar, Ritumoni Kalita, Rinku Moni Medhi, and Minakhi Barman – six of 40 members of women’s self-help groups (SHGs) who qualified for arguably the first short-term gender-specific course in India to operate, maintain, and repair UAVs or drones. They concluded their six-day training on Saturday, confident of adding wings to their mundane lives. Riju, 30, and Romina, 25, both from Nalbari district’s Barnagar Banekuchi village, are members of Sanjibani SHG and Maya SHG respectively. Social and economic pressures prevented them from pursuing their education beyond class 10, the former now a marginal farmer and the latter a daily-wage labourer. Their SHGs, into agriculture and allied activities, helped augment their family incomes but not to the extent they would have liked. “The course has made us realise technology can open up a world of opportunities for us. There are a range of agriculture services we never knew can be handled from the air,” Romina said. A member of Jonaki SHG in the same district’s Raimadha village, the 27-year-old Ritumoni graduated in humanities about five years ago. She hopes handling drones will now help her “graduate” from being a daily-wage labourer. The 31-year-old Rinku Moni of Narayanpur village’s Swagata SHG graduated in humanities too. As a homemaker, she has been better off than the other trainees but the urge to “do something on my own” made her sign up for the course. “Some of the trainees have a polytechnic background but by getting selected for the course, what all of them have conveyed is that it is important to at least complete school and have the urge to upgrade,” Krishna Baruah, the mission director of the Assam State Rural Livelihood Mission (ARSLM) said. The ARSLM collaborated with the Nalbari district administration headed by Deputy Commissioner Varnali Deka for the drone pilot and technology training at Nalbari Polytechnic in Chandkuchi, a village near Nalbari town about 70 km northwest of Guwahati. The Assam government subsequently decided to provide loans and training to the members of 15,000 SHGs for operating and repairing drones. “The Central and State governments are significant users of UAV applications. Once trained, these women SHG members will have ample opportunities as UAV pilots in agriculture, horticulture, healthcare, medicine deliver awareness campaigns, and even as drone trainers,” she said. Jayanta Malla Baruah, Assam’s Minister for Skill, Employment and Entrepreneurship said the DGCA-certified drone training could go a long way in making women SHGs self-reliant and opening up employment opportunities in multiple sectors. “We need at least 1 lakh drone operators to handle various government and non-government activities, even plant seeds and fertilise fields. We are also working on courses for advanced machinery operations for a range of specialised jobs,” he said. ",1
"Developed in India and consisting of a set of “mini-cubes” which can be airlifted and deployed on any terrain, the “world’s first portable disaster hospital” is now ready to be shared with the world.“This easy-to-use, mobile medical facility can be swiftly deployed to save lives in the most challenging circumstances. It can provide critical medical care to 100 survivors for up to 48 hours, making it a lifeline on remote and tough terrains where immediate medical attention is needed. The cubes [which are self-sustained healthcare units] can handle bullet, burn, head, spinal and chest injuries, fractures, and major bleeding. India is now equipped and ready to supply this to any country in need,” confirmed a senior Health Ministry official.He added that it can also provide help for tactical combat casualty care, massive haemorrhage, and hypothermia. The portable hospital was developed as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious ‘Project BHISHMA’ (Bharat Health Initiative for Sahyog Hita and Maitri) and consists of a fully equipped operation theatre, mini-ICUs, ventilators, blood-testing equipment, an X-ray machine, and even a cooking station. It also includes a shelter facility and power generator, making it entirely self-sufficient during emergencies. The life-saving equipment are packed in a set of “mini-cubes” and a combination of these mini-cubes is used to set up a mobile hospital capable of performing life-saving surgery. The mini-cubes are carried in a “Aarogya Maitri Cube Cage”, which has three frames, each accommodating 12 mini-cubes. An Aarogya Maitri Cube Cage can fit 36 mini-cubes overall.  Two such ‘Aarogya Maitri’ mother cubes combine to form a “brick” to complete the kit which is also water- and corrosion-proof. The kit also comes with a unique locking and tamper-proof system which is easy to locate, draw-out and use. It can be dismantled in various combinations based on availability of space.The Health Ministry official added that under this initiative, India is now equipped to provide critical medical supplies to developing countries grappling with the aftermath of natural disasters or humanitarian emergencies.Spearheaded by HLL Life Care, the government’s designated agency for sourcing the kit, and manufactured by multiple sellers collaborating to provide a diverse range of essential medical products, this project was initiated in 2022 through the Ministry of Defence.Meanwhile, India is also actively considering its deployment in remote tribal areas and has already gifted these units as a goodwill gesture to Sri Lanka and Myanmar.

"The Territorial Army (TA) has inducted five Chinese language interpreters in August to assist the Army at Border Personnel Meetings (BPM) with China, defence sources said. Also, there are plans for the recruitment of cyber experts. As part of the overall force reorganisation, the Army is in deliberations with the TA to convert some of the regular units, primarily logistics-related, into TA battalions, in order to bring down financial outflow, sources said. “The process for recruitment of Chinese language interpreters started in January and they were inducted in August. Five interpreters were recruited as per the Army’s requirement,” a defence source said. On the recruitment of cyber experts, the source said that deliberations were under way. The criteria for selection have been finalised and approval taken, and sanction for the proposal is expected by the end of the month. On the conversion of some regular Army units into TA battalions, the sources said talks are in preliminary stages and once the sanction is received, a pilot project would be undertaken with a few units. The TA, which is a citizens’ force raised by an Act of Parliament in 1948, currently has 60 units, of which 14 are deployed in counter insurgency duties in support of the Army and two units are in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. It also has departmental TA battalions funded by the Ministries of Environment and Forests, Jal Shakti, Railways and Petroleum. TA Units were deployed to support the Army in eastern Ladakh as part of Operation Snow Leopard at the peak of the stand-off with China in 2020, sources noted. Similarly, in May, as the crisis unfolded in Manipur, the TA oil units stepped in and took control of oil installations that were not operational and augmented manpower in order to ensure supplies of essential petroleum and oil products and refuelling of aircraft. Certain units are also deployed in conjunction with the Border Roads Organisation and Ministry of Railways for protection of under-construction road and rail alignments in remote and sensitive areas, the source stated. Two new ecological battalions are set to be raised in Maharashtra later this month on the request of the State government. The first Ecological Task Force (ETF) was raised in 1982, to protect the severely degraded hills of Mussoorie (Uttarakhand) due to intensive and incessant limestone quarrying and deforestation. Today, there are 10 ecological battalions deployed across the country. Various ETFs have jointly planted approximately 9.38 crore saplings in approximately 88,400 hectares across the country and also constructed 29 new water bodies besides rejuvenating many existing ones, officials said. A specialised TA ecological battalion, the Ganga Task Force, has been working on the conservation and rejuvenation of the Ganga in conjunction with the Ministry of Jal Shakti as part of the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG). They also help to prevent soil erosion, patrol ghats to prevent illegal activities and assist in curbing pollution. The unit personnel have also been employed in New Delhi to assist in the ongoing efforts to control pollution in the Yamuna, sources said. These TA battalions also undertake tree plantation and have annual target of 40-45 lakh trees. Land has to be given by State forest departments. The saplings are looked after for 3-5 years and the survivability rate is 80-85%.  Earlier, there were six TA railway battalions, however with technological advancements and changing requirements, the Ministry has decided to disband four of them, sources said.  The TA has also begun inducting women officers since 2019 and currently they are serving with TA oil sector units and TA railway engineer regiments. Based on the experience gained during this period, a proposal has been prepared to extend the employment scope further, the source stated. ",1
"GUWAHATIThe Manipur government has asked organisations and individuals in the State not to change the names of “districts, sub-divisions, places, institutions, and addresses of such institutions” on their own to create possible conflict between communities.The order issued by Chief Secretary Vineet Joshi on October 5 but released Friday night warned of “appropriate actions” according to the law if any organisation or individual is found involved in such renaming.There have been instances of some organisations changing the names of districts, places, and institutions on ethnic lines after the conflict between the tribal Kukis and non-tribal Meiteis broke out on May 3. Such actions create problems for the authorities, the Chief Secretary’s order said. “…it has come to the notice of the State government that many civil society organisations, institutions, establishments, and persons are deliberately renaming or trying to rename districts, sub-divisions, places, institutions, and address of such institutions,” the order said.“…these steps and actions are objectionable, or likely to create controversy and conflict between communities residing in the State, more particularly in the context of the ongoing law and order crisis [in the] aftermath [of] the Tribal Solidarity March organised by All Tribal Students Union Manipur on May 3,” it said.The State government, the order said, views the matter very seriously and with utmost sensitivity as it could create, divide, or aggravate the current law and order situation in Manipur.“Anyone found violating this order shall be prosecuted under relevant law of the land for the time being in force. All Central and State government authorities, management, institutions, establishment, autonomous bodies are also advised to check the name or address of respective offices/ establishments under them in all signage, official communications, websites, all documents related to services provided, etc., and also to ensure compliance of the orders,” the order said.The district magistrates and superintendents of police of all the districts have accordingly been asked to take necessary action to enforce the order.

"After promising a caste count in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, and vowing to release the caste data captured in 2015 in Karnataka soon, the Congress has now pledged to hold a caste survey in Madhya Pradesh, if it comes to power in the State. Speaking to reporters at the end of a three-hour long Congress Central Election Committee meeting, where the party deliberated over candidates for 130 to 140 seats, general secretary in-charge Randeep Surjewala said that the party’s primary agenda going into the Assembly election would be to conduct a caste count in the state.  “Ensuring justice for our brothers and sisters of the OBC (other backward class), SC (Scheduled Caste) and ST (Scheduled Tribe) communities is our primary agenda in Madhya Pradesh. A proper discussion on caste census was held and State chief Kamal Nath and other leaders informed [the CEC] that it will be our primary agenda in M.P.,” Mr. Surjewala said.Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath said that the names of candidates for about 130 to 140 seats were discussed during the meeting. However, sources said that the party will announce the first list only after October 15. “We have held discussions on several names. No decision has been made yet but we have discussed about 130 to 140 seats. We will meet again and make a decision in six-seven days,” Mr. Nath told reporters.Mr. Surjewala reiterated that Mr. Nath was the obvious Chief Ministerial face of the party. “Kamal Nath is president of Madhya Pradesh Congress. Whoever is the president of State Congress, that person is naturally the face of the party,” he said. He contrasted the clarity in the Congress with the confusion in the BJP regarding its Chief Ministerial face. Incumbent CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, he said, does not even know whether he will get a ticket this time around or not. “He [Mr. Chouhan] is now in danger which is why he has started to say all sorts of things now. He doubts whether he will contest from his constituency (Budhni) or not and whether Modi ji will give him a ticket or not,” he said. The Congress leader was hinting at some of Mr. Chouhan’s emotional speeches in the State in which he has asked the public whether he should contest the polls or not. The Congress is hoping that the anti-incumbency feeling against Mr. Chouhan, which had handed them victory in 2018, would work again in its favour. It has not lost a chance to underline the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been publicly distancing himself from Mr. Chouhan. “Madhya Pradesh now wants a change. This is why the Prime Minister has now distanced himself from Shivraj ji’s name and deeds both out of fear. He even hesitates from taking his [Mr. Chouhan’s] name,” Mr. Surjewala said.The BJP has already declared its candidates for 79 seats. In an unprecedented move, the ruling party has fielded three Union Ministers and four Members of Parliament in the Assembly polls, which are expected to take place by the end of this year. ",1
"Ambai was born in Tamil Nadu in 1944, and secured a Ph D from Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi. She started writing in the 1960s and through the 1970s and the 1980s as the only feminist writer in Tamil. She had to face the flak from the literary world, then predominantly upper class and male. “She bore the heat over two long decades, there was so much trash talk and belittling, comments. Nevertheless, she carried on, steadfastly, until the 90s maybe, when she had some company among feminist writers,” Mr. Sundaram explains. The inimitable Lakshmi Holmstrom translated her works for the world outside the Tamil tongue. In fact, Mr. Sundaram points out, other than Perumal Murugan, Ambai is perhaps the only other Tamil writer to have their entire oeuvre translated into English. Thanks to the translations, a larger world came to be introduced to her writings, the world of her characters, the spaces they inhabit, their lingo, their peculiar situations in life, the quotidian, always enlightened with perspective, and sometimes, an invariably sharp tongue. Ambai herself, reportedly, famously, told one of her editors of an anthology with ill-concealed annoyance at the typical slotting of women writers: there is no need to specify that I am a woman writer. She had a range of characters, well fleshed out within the short confines of the format she loved, knew well, and cherished — the short story. Be it the love-lorn demon Mahishan or Thangam Athai who never ‘blossomed’ as a woman, the daughter-in-law Minakshi who seeks an extension of the kitchen, even the intrepid investigator Sudha Gupta, her characters are flesh and blood; the women may have agency or not, but there’s an underpinning of quiet rebellion, understanding of social structure, a tacit agreement with feminist thought, and repeatedly, they question the gender order.

The BSP chief described such promises and announcements as ‘deceptions’ from fundamental issues like inflation, poverty, unemployment, and corruption.“The electoral environment has been affected because of various attractive promises made by the Congress and BJP before the next Assembly general elections.

"India’s first law enforcement Chief Information Security Officers’ (CISO) council was launched by DGP Anjani Kumar and Principal Secretary Jayesh Ranjan at the Cyberabad Police Commissionerate on Saturday. The CISO council will partner with public and private institutions to tackle cyber security threat in real time.The State police, with the support of industry and academia, launched the CISO council, in the presence of secretary for Society for Cyberabad Security Council (SCSC) Ramesh Kaza.“The definition of crime is changing fast. Cyber criminals operate remotely without any geographical constraints,” said Mr. Kumar during the launch.“This poses a lot of challenges for the police. The rate at which cyber crimes are rising, $8 trillion will be lost to cyber crimes by the end of 2023, which is almost a third of the GDP of the United States in 2022 and twice as much as India’s projected GDP this year,” he said.“The CISO council will be a beacon of cyber security in Telangana.

Cyber security breaches are multiplying and will grow by leaps and bounds when the next billion internet users start going digital. The enterprises are also going to be at risk,” said Mr. Ranjan.He cited an example of his meeting with Ajay Banga, formerly with Master Cards, who shared that the company in the US was subjected to 10,000 cyber attacks in a day and that the number would go up to 30,000 attempts.Mr. Ranjan asked the CISO council to work with the IT department and a few Centres of Excellence in the State such as Security Operations Centre, Cyber Security Centre of Excellence, Data Security Council of India and Computer Emergency Response Team. “The CISO council should work with start-ups as they are known for innovative and agile thinking and are tools of development, apart from engaging ethical hackers,” he said.“With a 300% increase in cyber crime cases in the last one year, we need to get our defence strong to tackle online crooks,” said Cyberabad Police Commissioner Stephen Raveendra.“Government organisations, critical infrastructure, and industry, including vulnerable MSMEs, are repeatedly besieged by threats and are ill-equipped to handle it, compared to their larger multinational counterparts.

On this historic day, the Chief of Air Staff will unveil the new IAF ensign,"" the IAF said.In the new ensign, the Indian Air Force crest will be in the top right corner.The Indian Air Force was officially established on 8 October, 1932. In view of its professional efficiency and achievements during World War II, the force was bestowed with the prefix ""Royal"" in March 1945. So, it became the Royal Indian Air Force (RIAF).In 1950, the IAF dropped its ""Royal"" prefix and amended the ensign as India became a republic.The RIAF ensign consisted of the Union Jack in the upper left canton and the RIAF roundel (red, white and blue) on the fly side. Post-Independence, the IAF ensign was created by replacing the Union Jack with the Indian tricolour and the RAF roundels with the IAF tricolour roundel in the lower right canton.""A new lAF ensign has now been created to better reflect the values of the Indian Air Force.

"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have provided an opportunity to a set of women in rural Assam to make their grounded dreams take flight again. Meet Riju Begum, Romina Begum, Himadri Talukdar, Ritumoni Kalita, Rinku Moni Medhi, and Minakhi Barman – six of 40 members of women’s self-help groups (SHGs) who qualified for arguably the first short-term gender-specific course in India to operate, maintain, and repair UAVs or drones. They concluded their six-day training on Saturday, confident of adding wings to their mundane lives. Riju, 30, and Romina, 25, both from Nalbari district’s Barnagar Banekuchi village, are members of Sanjibani SHG and Maya SHG respectively. Social and economic pressures prevented them from pursuing their education beyond class 10, the former now a marginal farmer and the latter a daily-wage labourer. Their SHGs, into agriculture and allied activities, helped augment their family incomes but not to the extent they would have liked. “The course has made us realise technology can open up a world of opportunities for us. There are a range of agriculture services we never knew can be handled from the air,” Romina said. A member of Jonaki SHG in the same district’s Raimadha village, the 27-year-old Ritumoni graduated in humanities about five years ago. She hopes handling drones will now help her “graduate” from being a daily-wage labourer. The 31-year-old Rinku Moni of Narayanpur village’s Swagata SHG graduated in humanities too. As a homemaker, she has been better off than the other trainees but the urge to “do something on my own” made her sign up for the course. “Some of the trainees have a polytechnic background but by getting selected for the course, what all of them have conveyed is that it is important to at least complete school and have the urge to upgrade,” Krishna Baruah, the mission director of the Assam State Rural Livelihood Mission (ARSLM) said. The ARSLM collaborated with the Nalbari district administration headed by Deputy Commissioner Varnali Deka for the drone pilot and technology training at Nalbari Polytechnic in Chandkuchi, a village near Nalbari town about 70 km northwest of Guwahati. The Assam government subsequently decided to provide loans and training to the members of 15,000 SHGs for operating and repairing drones. “The Central and State governments are significant users of UAV applications. Once trained, these women SHG members will have ample opportunities as UAV pilots in agriculture, horticulture, healthcare, medicine deliver awareness campaigns, and even as drone trainers,” she said. Jayanta Malla Baruah, Assam’s Minister for Skill, Employment and Entrepreneurship said the DGCA-certified drone training could go a long way in making women SHGs self-reliant and opening up employment opportunities in multiple sectors. “We need at least 1 lakh drone operators to handle various government and non-government activities, even plant seeds and fertilise fields. We are also working on courses for advanced machinery operations for a range of specialised jobs,” he said. ",1
