I am too worried and scared, it was horrifying.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Men, women and children stood out in the wide streets, away from tall buildings, in the moments after the first quake and remained wary of returning to their homes as aftershocks rumbled for hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The situation was very horrible, I have never experienced such a thing,\" said 21-year-old student Idrees Arsala, the last to safely evacuate his classroom as the quakes began.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>\"Buried under the rubble\"</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early on Saturday evening, disaster management authority spokesman Mullah Jan Sayeq told AFP that the number of fatalities was expected \"to rise very high\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"There are some areas that are totally collapsed and all the houses are damaged,\" he said. \"People are still buried under the rubble. The aid agencies are trying to reach the area.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hundreds of fatalities were possible, according to a USGS preliminary estimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread. Past events with this alert level have required a regional or national level response,\" it said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The USGS had earlier reported the first quake's magnitude as 6.2. It had a shallow depth of just 14 kilometres, it said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Herat -- 120 kilometres east of the border with Iran -- is considered the cultural capital of Afghanistan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the capital of Herat province, which is home to an estimated population of 1.9 million, according to 2019 World Bank data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Afghanistan is frequently hit by earthquakes, especially in the Hindu Kush mountain range, which lies near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June last year, more than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left homeless after a 5.9-magnitude quake -- the deadliest in Afghanistan in nearly a quarter of a century -- struck the impoverished province of Paktika.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March of this year, 13 people were killed in Afghanistan and Pakistan by a magnitude 6.5 quake, which hit near Jurm in northeastern Afghanistan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Afghanistan is already in the grip of a grinding humanitarian crisis, following the widespread withdrawal of foreign aid since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.</p><p><i>(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)</i></p>",

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi had blamed Punjab's farm fires for air pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR) in 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A year later, the AAP came to power in Punjab, and had promised it would control stubble burning. Now, two years later, stubble-burning in the border state is back again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sources said the AAP has not done any effective work to ensure the deadly farm fires do not return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann, calling himself the \"son of a farmer\", had met farmer leaders to persuade them not to burn crop stubble. He had claimed many panchayats in Punjab even passed resolutions against burning of crop residue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His Delhi counterpart and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal last year said, \"I expect that from next year, stubble burning incidents will come down. We will take steps to ensure this. Both our governments are responsible for stubble-burning in Punjab.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, Mr Kejriwal said case of stubble-burning have fallen significantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Punjab farmers are back to burning crop residue at the onset of the harvesting season. Many farmers have complained that access to crushing machines like bailers and seeders are still unfulfilled goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Mann's call for crop diversification, too, has not been helpful as alternative crops are still expensive for farmers to afford. The farmers say they are not behind air pollution, but are also the victims of this menace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though farm fire cases have reduced in the past two years, over 30,000 acres were still set on fire last year. The number of farm fire cases reported in the past two years till now was: 2021 (320), 2022 (630) and 2023 (845).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of stubble-burning cases reported between September and October this year is as high as 845, up from less than 600 last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Delhi's air quality has fallen from \"poor\" to \"very poor\" category, and the particulate matter PM2.5 levels are 60 times more than the World Health Organisation's safe limit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The graded action response plan (GARP) level 1 has kicked in and the impact in Delhi is clearly visible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first stage of the emergency pollution plan has led to a blanket ban on coal and firewood and restriction on truck traffic in Delhi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi was recorded at 231 at 9 am. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.</p>",

					"descr": "<p><a href=\"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/players/174-rahul-dravid-playerprofile\" title=\"Rahul Dravid\">Rahul Dravid</a> has done his bit as the coach of the Indian cricket team. After preparing his players for the grandest arena of their career, he now wants to retreat to the backstage and let <a href=\"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/players/857-rohit-sharma-playerprofile\" title=\"Rohit Sharma\">Rohit Sharma</a>'s bunch create their own beautiful story. \"Honestly once the game starts, it's the captain's team. It's the team that needs to take it forward, they need to execute it, they need to do the job,\" Dravid said during his interaction with the media on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"As a coach I see my work in the lead up to the games, in the lead up to this World Cup, trying to get the squad we got eventually. Building up the team, building up the squad and then hoping to allow the players to play and express themselves to have fun,” said Dravid, who is known for his economy of emotions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Controlling the controllables is Dhoni's favourite phrase but no one believes in it more than Dravid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Yeah... I mean I guess you recognise as a coach that once the game starts, once the guys cross the line, there is only so much you can do. As coaches, we don't score a single run or take a single wicket in the tournament. All we can do is really support the players.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The job of a coach requires honesty in assessment, something that Dravid keeps in his head always.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"A lot of our work, to be very honest with you, is in the days leading up to these games. It's in the practice sessions, hopefully the kind of mind space we get the people in and supporting the captain and the team in whatever way we can in the lead up,\" he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked what could be a safe total in the tournament, Dravid gave a tongue in cheek reply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Just one more than the opposition, I think will be very safe [laughs]. Look, it's hard to tell, hard to predict, in each condition. And that's going to be the beauty of this World Cup,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dravid was essentially hinting at the variety in venues and pitches during this tournament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“So many venues that these matches are going to be played in. So many different wickets on those venues. Some of the squares…even in India, you have red soil, black soil, you have a mix of red and black.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Each one is going to be unique. I don't think you can go and say that this is going to be a safe total, that's not going to be a safe total,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supplementing his logic, Dravid said: “We'll probably play on a relatively bigger ground here in Chennai compared to say when we go to Bangalore or when we go to Delhi. Each venue will be different, we'll just have to assess and see what it's luck.” So, did he watch <a href=\"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/players/113659-rachin-ravindra-playerprofile\" title=\"Rachin Ravindra\">Rachin Ravindra</a>'s blazing hundred against England on Thursday? “Yeah, bits and pieces of it. I thought both of them (Ravindra and <a href=\"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/players/45400-devon-philip-conway-playerprofile\" title=\"Devon Conway\">Devon Conway</a>) played really well. Obviously, they got New Zealand off to a really flying start in the tournament and looked like the wicket really became a good one as the game went on.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2007 World Cup looks ancient</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2007 World Cup wasn't his finest hour and Dravid said it was in his past life. \"It's a long time since I was a player. I almost forgot that I was actually a cricket player at one stage to be very honest with you,\" the smile was a bit self-deprecating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I have moved on from that. I don't think of myself as a player anymore. Maybe that's the mind space difference... I'm focussed on helping the group to do the best they can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"I mean in the end that's the job of the support staff, the job of the coach really is to support the vision of the captain and help him execute his vision over the course of the next couple of months and hope we can do that really well.\"</p>",

					"descr": "<p>Aiden Markram smashed the fastest World Cup century off just 49 balls, while Quinton De Kock and Rassie van der Dussen also made punishing hundreds as South Africa sounded early warning with a mammoth 428/5 against Sri Lanka in their World Cup match on Saturday. This was the third 400-plus total by South Africa in Cricket World Cup history as they became the first team ever to achieve this feat. De Kock (100 off 84 balls), Dussen (108 off 110 balls) and Markram (106 off 54 balls) went on a rampage to power South Africa past the highest World Cup total ever — Australia's 417/7 against Afghanistan in the 2015 edition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Highest team totals in ODI Cricket World Cup</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>428/5 - SA vs SL, Delhi 2023*<br />\r\n417/6 - AUS vs AFG, Perth 2015<br />\r\n413/5 - IND vs BER, Port of Spain 2007<br />\r\n411/4 - SA vs IRE, Canberra 2015<br />\r\n408/5 - SA vs WI, Sydney, 2015</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After De Kock and Van der Dussen set the platform for a massive score with their second-wicket stand with 204 runs, Markram applied a brutal coup de grace to pulverise Sri Lanka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All three South African centurions — De Kock, Van der Dussen and Markram — also recorded their maiden World Cup hundreds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A total of 39 fours and eight sixes came collectively from the Proteas trio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heinrich Klaasen hit another three fours and a six for his 20-ball 32 and David Miller clobbered three fours and two sixes for his unbeaten 21-ball 39.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making the most of a favourable pitch against a depleted and erring Sri Lankan bowling line-up, South African batters motored on at a high scoring rate in the middle-overs to wrest control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An early blow was dealt when Dilshan Madushanka pinned Temba Bavuma (8) in front of the wicket, but that was the only moment of joy for the Sri Lankans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De Kock and Van der Dussen, came together a mere 10 balls into the contest, were separated only after putting their team in a commanding position with the fourth highest ever partnership for any wicket for South Africa in the World Cup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De Kock, set to retire from ODIs after the tournament, was in his elements in getting a hundred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, Van der Dussen celebrated his 50th ODI with a fifth ton of the career, cracking 13 fours and two sixes in the process. Markram began with two cracking straight drives for four off Madushanka and brought out every conventional stroke in his book to break the record set by Ireland's Kevin O'Brien (50 balls for 100) in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Van der Dussen survived a close chance on 65 when a mistimed hit fell very close to Sadeera Samarawickrama, who, placed at short midwicket, responded tad late and missed the catch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With no turn or grip for SL spinners, the South African batters capitalised with the ball sliding on to the bat in the middle overs. In fact, 85 runs came in overs between 19 and 29 featuring 11 fours and two sixes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dunith Wellalage bowled five straight dots to the right-handed Van der Dussen in the 26th over which forced the batter to try breaking the trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An attempted reverse-sweep sent the ball flying close to Pathum Nissanka, who put in a dive to his right but his one-handed effort had the ball popping out of his hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 29th over, another chance to break the partnership went begging when a mix-up between De Kock and Van der Dussen left both batters vulnerable to a run-out. But a throw at the wrong end — which also missed the stumps — kept the pair intact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, De Kock fell right after completing the milestone, getting a top edge on a short ball off Pathirana in the 31st over and Van der Dussen also did not push on much after his century.</p>",

In 1947, the United Nations voted to divide Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem under international administration. The Jewish leadership embraced the plan, but the Arab side rejected it, and it was never implemented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1948, unable to end the strife, British authorities withdrew and Jewish leaders proclaimed the founding of Israel. Many Palestinians objected, and a war ensued. Neighboring Arab countries intervened with military force. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or \"The Catastrophe\".</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>War And Peace</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, Israel and Palestine have been involved in several skirmishes, some minor, some of catastrophic proportions that led to the deaths of thousands.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1987, Hamas, an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya (Islamic Resistance Movement), a political group with military capabilities, was launched by Palestinian cleric Sheikh Ahmed Yassin as a political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Sunni Islamist organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>READ |</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/video-i-call-on-all-citizens-israels-defence-minister-on-war-by-hamas-4458798\">Video: \"I Call On All Citizens...\": Israel's Defence Minister On \"War\" By Hamas</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two Palestinian uprisings, or 'intifadas', profoundly impacted Israeli-Palestinian relations, especially the second, which ended the 1990s peace process and ushered in a new era of conflict.

					"title": "Opinion: Rahul Gandhi Crafts His Own Narrative, Separate From Congress",
					"link": "https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/rahul-gandhi-crafts-his-own-narrative-separate-from-congress-4456232",
					"descr": "<p>Rahul Gandhi's call of <em>\"jitni aabadi utna haq\"</em> (quota proportionate to strength in population), designed to draw the OBCs (Other Backward Castes), is plagiarised from a slogan first raised by Ram Manohar Lohia in 1956 and adopted by the Samyukta Socialist Party (SSP) in 1961. The Lohiaites asserted, <em>\"Sansopa ney baandhi hai gaanth, pichhdey pawen sau mein saath\"</em> (SSP has resolved that the Backwards must get 60 percent). The Congress under Jawaharlal Nehru, while sympathetic to the cause of the deprived, did not agree with this caste-slogan being incorporated into political agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1980s, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) founder Kanshi Ram modified the Lohiaite clarion: <em>\"Jiski jitni sankhya bhaari, uski utni hissedari\"</em>. Both slogans emerged during Congress rule. The Grand Old Party did not rush to imitate or emulate the chant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Mandal Commission report drove the political discourse in the Janata Dal-National Front days, Rajiv Gandhi, speaking in Parliament as Leader of Opposition on September 6, 1990, questioned the haste with which VP Singh railroaded the decision, provoking strife on the streets (self-immolation by youth included). \"Let us not have one man's obstinacy holding India hostage,\" thundered Rajiv Gandhi, pointing out inadequacies in the Mandal report. Referencing the Indira Gandhi-era slogan <em>\"Na jaat par na paat par; Indiraji ki baat par, mohar lagegi Haath par\"&nbsp;</em>(Not on caste on creed, Congress will won votes on Indira Gandhi's assurances), Rajiv Gandhi cited a Congress Working Committee resolution of August 30 to underscore his party's stand. He subscribed to economic backwardness, not caste, as the yardstick for reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2023, there has been no animated intra-party discussion on this. This was reflected in a post on \"X\" by Congress MP and legal luminary Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who cautioned against a \"recipe for majoritarianism\". Singhvi later backtracked. Congress circles say he was nudged by the head of the publicity department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SSP, which was a leading opposition party in parliament in the initial years of Independence (it merged with the Janata Party in 1977), used the banyan tree as its symbol (it is now frozen by the Election Commission). The banyan is a tree with offshoots. Many offshoots of that banyan tree survive and thrive today - Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party (founded by his father Mulayam Singh Yadav), Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal, and Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By conducting and publishing a caste survey in Bihar, Nitish Kumar, who rose in politics along with Lalu Yadav and Late Ram Vilas Paswan as an activist of SSP's youth wing Samajwadi Yuvjan Sabha (SYS), has magnificently upheld his political legacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rahul Gandhi, by jumping into the caste survey and the <em>\"Jitni abaadi utna haq\"</em> debate, has departed from Congress's legacy, perhaps on the hope that it may stem the party's downslide since Narendra Modi's emergence. The Congress has retained nearly 20% national votes in the past two polls. Will its bash at a Hindutva agenda, and a Mandal plank, help enhance its base? Or could there be attrition?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mallikarjun Kharge's anointment as Congress President in March 2022 notwithstanding, Rahul Gandhi, aided by his trusted party general secretary, KC Venugopal, is the pivot of the Congress. No decision can be taken without their say-so. Kharge, who has not even delivered a new set of central office bearers, doesn't seem uncomfortable with this arrangement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congress leaders say in private that in 2024, their party will be the fulcrum of an alliance regime. Kharge's name is mentioned as the possible head of that confabulation. Manmohan Singh 2.0 is being conjectured amid talk of Mandal 2.0. For that, Rahul Gandhi is prepared to be flexible, so that glitches do not thwart the \"INDIA\" alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This flexibility was in evidence during his visit to Amritsar over the past few days. He visited the Golden Temple on a religious visit and participated in rituals of <em>sewa</em> (service) - cleaning shoes, washing utensils, carrying a palanquin, etcetera. A stern statement was issued by Punjab Congress chief, Amrinder Raja Warring, forbidding party workers from trying to contact Rahul Gandhi as he was on a \"personal visit\". This, at a time leaders of all political parties are busy crisscrossing the countryside for the upcoming election season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rahul Gandhi is entitled to his privacy. What irked Punjab party workers was that while their supreme leader was visiting their state, a third term MLA of the party, Sukhpal Singh Khaira, was imprisoned by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) regime. There were state-wide protests by the Congress. Rahul Gandhi was oblivious of this. Many former Congress ministers are also facing AAP's offensive. None of the central Congress leaders (who rushed to issue statements protesting the detention of AAP MP Sanjay Singh) reacted to these incidents. Apparently, bonhomie with AAP is more sensible for the health of the \"INDIA\" alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AAP's tantrums at the first \"INDIA\" meet in Patna made all fall in line behind Arvind Kejriwal on the Delhi Services Ordinance, the objections of local party units notwithstanding. Home Minister Amit Shah successfully piloted the Bill and the AAP-induced unity failed to yield results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reciprocation does not seem to be AAP's credo. When Mamata Banerjee's nephew and Trinamool Congress general secretary Abhishek Banerjee led an agitation on West Bengal's grievances against the Centre on October 2-3 in New Delhi, not a single AAP volunteer was spotted anywhere near them. Trinamool ministers, MPs and MLAs were jostled by the police on Day One and arrested (women MPs like Mohua Moitra were dragged and bodily lifted) on Day Two. No member of the \"INDIA\" alliance empathised with the Trinamool protestors. The alliance seems to be marked more by its diversity than unity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The row over the caste census and its aftermath, which has placed Narendra Modi on the crosshairs of the \"INDIA\" bloc, stems from the fact that the BJP has slowly but steadily usurped the \"Mandal\" agenda while keeping alive its \"kamandal\" stance of Hindutva.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, the BJP polled 22% of the OBC votes, while the Congress was backed by 24%. Regional parties won 54%. After the emergence of Modi, himself an OBC (his caste mooring is among EBCs or Extremely Backward Classes, the lower strata of the OBC spectrum), the BJP's share shot up to 34% in 2014 and 44% in 2019 (Breakup: 40% OBCs and 48% EBCs backed BJP, making an average of 44). The Congress plummeted to 15% in 2014 and 2019. The share of regional parties was 51% and 41%.
